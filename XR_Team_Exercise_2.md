<p style="text-align: center;">David Kallemeyn</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Last Revised Spring 2024</p>

**Due:** 4/10/2024 by 10:00 PM 

**Submission:** github repo link uploaded in canvas. The repo should contain your **team_ex_2.py** file and documentation of your process (you can use github, this document, a readme file, or other method).

**Assignment type:** Team, In-class 

**Points:** Complete/Incomplete. No points are assigned. Extra credit points may be awarded to teams based on their approach and solutions. 

#### INSTRUCTIONS
The file **team_ex_2.py** contains a naive solution to the Pair Exercise #4 assignment, which you are familiar with having recently submitted a solution. The code uses the _wikipedia_ package and downloads references for related pages to a specified topic. This file has 4 functions: 
1. a function to execute the task sequentially 
2. a function to execute with multiple threads
3. a function to execute with multiple processes
4. a helper function to convert objects to strings

General advice/resources:
- you will need a virtual environment with the wikipedia package installed
- you may want to use wrapper functions or other abstractions

## Problem
Your task is to review the code in the **team_ex_2.py** file, discuss it as a team, and refactor the code to be more efficient and adaptable. Your review process should include:
- identification of possible issues
- creation of tasks
- assignment of tasks
- description of each issue and how it was resolved 

In addition to issues/areas for improvement discovered in the codebase, the refactored solution must add the following new functionality:
- allow the user to specify their own search term
- if the user input search term is less than 4 characters, it should default to "generative artificial intelligence"
- create a new directory named "wiki_dl" in which to store the created .txt files
