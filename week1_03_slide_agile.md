### [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

***Individuals and interactions*** over processes and tools 
***Working software*** over comprehensive documentation 
***Customer collaboration*** over contract negotiation 
***Responding to change*** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### [Principles of Agile #1-4](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

---
### Principles of Agile #5-8

Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

---
### Principles of Agile #9-12

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

---
That forms the foundation for agile software development. As with any human endeavor, there are a number of ways these can be interpreted and operationalized.

These principles form a philosophy, almost religious in terms of how they are used.  They have spawned a number of methods with various principles.

### How will these principles be brought into the course?
- Pilone & Miles text
- Readings
- Explorations of some of the more popular methods
- Use in exercises and the team project

---
Information systems is at the intersection of social science and computer science

Many of the readings will have a social science/ management/ organizational behavior component

## Nerur & Balijepally 2007
Presents software development as a "wicked problem", one where:
- the problem is complex and difficult to articulate
- the problem does not have a static solution and changes over time
- multiple conflicting viewpoints are present (no easily identified desirable outcomes to optimize)

Applied design lessons from what field(s)?

---
Strategic thinking in design
old methods characterized by:
- formulaic and prescriptive thinking (advanced knowing)
- mechanistic worldview: predictable, verifiable, controllable
- past experience (backward looking)

new methods characterized by:
- emergent processes centered around learning
- constant questioning through cycles of formulation, implementation and reflection
- dynamic worldview: uniqueness, ambiguity, complexity and change
