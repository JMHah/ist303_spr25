# What is Scrum?
from scrumguides.org:

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

---
### Scrum Theory
- founded on empiricism and lean thinking:  knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed.
- employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk.
- combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event (Sprint).
- Scrum is primarily defined by its _roles, practices, and values,_ all of which are deliberately kept to a minimum.

---
### Scrum Roles
Scrum teams are small, self-managing, and not hierarchical
- **Scrum Master**: facilitate scrum use, ensure the scrum framework is followed
- **Product Owner**: represents the customer's interests; create and manage product backlog based on customer requirements and communicates to development what is important to deliver
- **Developers**: people who contribute to the development of the product (designers, writers, programmers, etc.)

---
### Scrum practices
Sprint: fixed length of time (1 month or less) where the work is done
- Sprint planning: lays out the work to be done
- Stand-up meeting: short daily meeting to discuss progress and identify obstacles. Originally termed “stand-up” so that they would have to be short if everyone stood.
- Sprint review: inspect the outcome of the sprint, discuss product backlog
- Sprint retrospective: the team identifies the most helpful changes to improve effectiveness

---
### Scrum Values
- Commitment
- Focus
- Openness
- Respect
- Courage

# Kadenic et al: "Mastering scrum with a focus on team maturity and key components of scrum"

---
## What they were interested in
Software development success has been evaluated in terms of:
- evaluation of project outcome metrics
- stakeholder satisfaction 
- team performance

Kadenic et al looked at team maturity and its impact on team performance, using Scrum as the agile method of focus due to its popularity

---
### Research Model
![h:450](rsc/kadenic.png)

---
### Research Questions
- Does team maturity impact the perception of successful application of the Scrum framework?
  - perception of success was associated with team maturity (0.537)
- How does team composition impact the perception of successful application of the Scrum framework?
  - most significant factors: fully allocated team members, team members received agile training, self-managing teams. 

---
### Research Questions, cont'd

- How do Scrum values impact the perception of successful application of the Scrum framework? \
3 values were significant w/respect to perceived success:
  - teams who stated that scrum values provide direction in their work
  - teams who can communicate openly about work and challenges with stakeholders
  - teams who have the courage to work on tough problems and do the right thing

---
### Research Questions, cont'd
-  How do Scrum roles impact the perception of successful application of the Scrum framework? \

All 3 roles determined to contribute to successful outcomes. Specific findings:
    - developers’ ability to daily adapt their plan towards the sprint goal
    - product owners having the mandate to prioritize 
    - Scrum masters’ ability to ensure that all Scrum events take place

---
## Findings
Key factors in the successful application of scrum:
- team maturity (how long the team has been in existence) 
- team members with the necessary skills and expertise 
- low turnover rate among team members 
- ability to self-manage and make decisions internally 
- team members receive agile training

---
### Extreme Programming
A software development framework that seeks to produce high quality of code _and_ high quality of life for the developers.

Where scrum is minimally structured and purposefully focused on higher-level concerns, XP is specific and focuses on prescriptive practices.

### XP Practices (12 original practices)
- The Planning Game
- Small Releases
- Metaphor
- Simple Design
- Testing
- Refactoring
- Pair Programming
- Collective Ownership
- Continuous Integration
- 40-hour week
- On-site Customer
- Coding Standard

---
### XP Revised Practices
_from agilealliance.org_
- sit together
- whole team: cross-functional groups that all work together
- informative workspace: facilitate communication
- energized work: distraction-free
- pair programming: all production software is developed in this manner (one screen, 2 programmers)
- stories
- weekly cycle (iteration)

---
### XP Revised Practices, cont'd
- quarterly cycle (milestone): keep weekly work in context of larger project
- slack: include low-priority tasks in that can be dropped if needed
- ten-minute build: build and test system in 10 minutes
- continuous integration: code changes immediately tested
- test-first programming: write test, fail test, write code to pass test
- incremental design

## Scrum and XP 
- Compare the two methods

- Which do you gravitate towards?
- What would you prioritize: specific practices or philosophical approach?
