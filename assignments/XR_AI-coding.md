**Submission**: File upload (your responses to the assignment below) \
**Due**: 5/7/2025, 6:59 PM \
**Assignment type**: Individual \
**Points**: Complete/Incomplete. Included in participation grade.

#### INSTRUCTIONS
Note that this is an individual assignment. You will be creating a copy of your group repository on your local machine, in a new directory. Do NOT push any changes to your group repo or make any changes to the repo submitted for your group projects as those must have a last commit date no later than the Part D due date.

Clone the group repo on your machine \
`git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/GROUP_REPO_NAME.git path-on-local-machine'` \
where _path-on-local-machine_ is the directory path you want it placed into.

You will use this new directory on your local drive to experiment with various AI tools. Document your experiences and be prepared to discuss your experiences during the May 7th class session.

You are free to use an IDE-integrated tool as you code or a general conversational tool such as ChatGPT to upload your code snippets. You should use both methods at least once in order to be able to make a comparison, but there are not requirements to use a particular mode of interaction for any particular section of the assignment. Note which tool and model you used in each portion.

1. Select a file or block of code and ask the tool to refactor the code. Try the suggested code, document how you feel it performed.

2. Select a file or block of code and ask the tool to "make it better". Repeat this request 5 times, each time taking notes on what is changing, as well as whether you deem it to indeed be "making it better". Was there a point where it delivered diminishing returns? Things you can consider when thinking about "better" code:
   - simplicity (maintainability)
   - readable/understandable
   - reliable
   - speed / memory use
   - lines of code
   - extendable

3. Ask the tool to add functionality to the codebase. You are free to be creative here, but here are some examples you are free to use:
   - have it deploy your app to a server with appropriate tooling and configuration
   - add functionality you didn't get to in milestone 2
   - bug fixes and enhancements 

4. Practice a brief pair programming session where you have an idea of what you want to add and use the tool to bounce ideas off of, review your code, ask for help and feedback along the way. Document your experiences.

5. Have the tool generate documentation for the codebase.

6. Revisit your thoughts on "Programming as Theory" - do you feel any differently? Why?

7. Generate some notes for both sides of the argument: 
   - AI tools are overhyped/not particularly useful, and 
   - AI tools are revolutionary and will change the way coding is done. 
   
   Use your experiences from this assignment to support the positions. Be prepared to discuss in class next week.
