#### INSTRUCTIONS
In this assignment you will code some functions and classes based on provided specifications. Tests have already been written that you will use to test your code. You will need to test your code, then make adjustments to your code to attempt to have it pass all of the needed tests. You will also need to create a new github repository where you and your partner store your code so that the instructor can download your _pe3.py_ file in order to run the tests. 

Code the functions and classes as outlined below in a single file named **pe3.py** and push it to a gihub repository named **303_Spring_25**. Either partner can create the repository, you both do not need to.

The file **test_pe3.py** has a number of tests that will be used to evaluate your code. Your code should pass 25 tests, with each passed test worth 2 points. Your code is also expected to fail 2 tests, these are not scored and included only to illustrate XFAIL (expected to fail) tests in pytest.

To test your code, do the following:
- download the **test_pe3.py** and **pytest.ini** files and place them in the same directory as your _pe3.py_ file (the purpose of the .ini file is to supresses some warnings, it does not contain any tests). The file containing your code and the test files _must all be in the same directory_ or the test file as written will fail to test your file.
- make sure you have _pytest_ installed (globally, or if you are working in a virtual environment make sure it is active)
- run the test file with pytest using the following command from the terminal (in the directory where your files are located): \
`pytest -v test_pe3.py`

## Contents of your pe3.py file
The remainder of this document describes the code you need to write.

## Functions
Caesarâ€™s cipher is a cryptography scheme attributed to the Roman Emperor Julian Caesar who used it to communicate with his associates while aiming to prevent eavesdropping. In its simplest form, the cipher uses a substitution mechanism i.e., each letter in the communicated text is replaced by another, unique letter. The substitution is specified by a shift parameter, D, which denotes how many positions down the alphabet the replacing letter resides. More details on how the cipher works can be found in this Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher

In this part of the exercise, you will create two functions: **encode** and **decode**.

A. Create an encoding function called **encode** that takes two arguments:
  - **input_text**, which is the text to be encrypted, and
  - **shift**, which is the number of places to shift along the alphabet to where the replacing letter resides.

The function should return a tuple that consists of two items:
1. a list of all lowercase letters of the English alphabet, and
2. the encoded text

Example function calls and expected output are shown below:
```
encode ("a", 3) # should return ([" a" , "b" , ... "z"] , "d")

encode (" abc", 4 ) # should return ([" a" , "b" , ... "z"] , " efg ")

encode (" xyz", 3 ) # should return ([" a" , "b" , ... "z"] , " abc ")

encode ("j!K,2?", 3) # should return ([" a" , "b" , ... "z"] , "m!n,2 ?")
```

B. Create a decoding function called **decode** that takes two arguments:
  - **input_text**, which is the text to be decrypted, and
  - **shift**, which is the number of places to shift along the alphabet to where the replacing letter resides.

The function should return _only the decoded text_.

Examples of function calls for the decode function:
```
decode ("d", 3) # should return "a"
decode (" efg", 4 ) # should return " abc "
decode (" abc", 3 ) # should return " xyz "
decode ("m!n,2?", 3) # should return "j!K,2 ?"
```

## Classes
### A. BankAccount

Create a class called BankAccount (capitalization matters).

The class is initialized with the following attributes:
- owner's name (name)
- alphanumeric id (ID)
- date of account creation (creation_date). this MUST be of type datetime.date.
- account balance (balance)

The BankAccount class should have the following default values set:
- name: "Rainy"
- ID: "1234"
- creation_date: datetime.date.today()
- balance: 0

The BankAccount class must have the following (instance) methods that take the listed arguments:
- deposit(amount)
- withdraw(amount)
- view_balance()

The BankAccount class must obey the following rules:
- the date of creation may be a past date or today, but cannot be a future date. 
- A date supplied with a future creation date must raise an exception of class Exception.
- negative deposit amounts are not allowed
- withdrawal and deposit actions should display the resulting account balance.

### B. SavingsAccount
Create a subclass of BankAccount called **SavingsAccount**. SavingsAccount must follow the BankAccount rules plus the following:
- withdrawals are only permitted after the account has been in existence for 180 days.
- overdrafts (negative account balance) are not permitted.

### C. CheckingAccount
Create a subclass of BankAccount called **CheckingAccount**. CheckingAccount must follow the BankAccount rules plus the following:
- overdrafts are permitted, but incur a $30 fee each time a withdrawal results in a negative balance.

### Additional instructions
Be sure that your names are precisely consistent with the following, or the tests will not work (capitalization matters):

Class names: 
 - BankAccount
 - CheckingAccount
 - SavingsAccount

Method Names: 
 - deposit(self, amount) 
 - withdraw(self, amount)
 - view_balance(self)
